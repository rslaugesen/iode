# iode
Iode is an educational software package for ordinary and partial differential equations, and Fourier series

The 2018 version is almost identical to the 2013 version. One line of code in fixaxes.m has been commented out. That line relates to running Iode under Octave (which we no longer support), and it generated an error message when running Iode under Matlab R2018. By commenting out that line, Iode now works once again under Matlab (and presumably no longer works under Octave).
